Irrigation is an essential part of farming. As we know, it needs to be done daily, and due to this fact, whatever may be the distance between farm and home, the farmer has to go to their crop fields every day to turn on the irrigation system and supply water to crops.  There are two cons of this daily travel to crop fields, waste of both time and money.  So, we felt like traveling is not a viable option when it can be done remotely. With GSM based agriculture motor control it's that simple; sitting at home, clicking a button on your smartphone and controlling motors!
